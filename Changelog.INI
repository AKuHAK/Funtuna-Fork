[1.0.0]

	Funtuna Configurator:
		Changed Skin
			Now the configurations will be stored at FUNTUNA.CNF instead of FMCB.CNF (To avoid conflicts with FreeMcBoot when saving configs to mass:/)
		
		disable timestamp-manipulation feature.  it is causing compiling issues so i had to disable it untill HWNJ helps me to solve that or i find out the answer on my own
		
	BOOT.ELF:
		Graphic interface:
			Restored config reading for Top delimiter, bottom delimiter and both cursors (no more hardcoded Text)
		 USB Drivers:
			if FUNTUNA cant find the USB drivers at mc?:/BOOT/it will try to find them at mc?:/SYS-CONF/
			
			
			
		Launch keys:
			hardcoded launch keys modified:
					the original hardcoded paths for AUTO include mc?:/BOOT/BOOT ELF at path 2
					if funtuna cant find the config file (or the config doesn not have entries for AUTO launch keys) 
                    and there isnt an elf file located at mass:/BOOT/BOOT.ELF funtuna will launch himself causing an endless loop.
                    now the hardcoded AUTO LK launches Mc0:/BOOT/ULE.ELF instead of Funtuna
                    
		FORTUNA:
			the Fortuna Icon file wont be at  "BOOT" anymore, it will be located at "BXEXEC-FUNTUNA"
			DONT TOUCH ANYTHING INSIDE THAT FOLDER
			
			
			
			
[comming soon...]
