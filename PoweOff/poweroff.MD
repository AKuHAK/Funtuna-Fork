# PowerOff

this folder contains POWEROFF.ELF source Code

to compile this is a decent size youll need the [Precompiled SDK for windows made by sp193](https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2toolchain/releases/tag/2018-10-19)

with that SDK the size will be ~15kb

with the latest SDK the size grows into ~160kb
